### Version
0.0.1 
This is the very first version of this app and it's only been optimized for the Iphone 6 but if you feel comfortable laoding the project into Xcode it shouldn't be too hard to change things. 

### Arduino 
Check out the arduino folder to find the code you'll to push to your board via Arduino Sketch

Also included is the Adafruit library that has all sorts of cool effects like the rainbow mode. 


### Attributions
This app is base on the Arduino Tutorial posted by Owen L Brown here. http://www.raywenderlich.com/85900/arduino-tutorial-integrating-bluetooth-le-ios-swift

If you want to start diving into the code I would suggest starting there.
